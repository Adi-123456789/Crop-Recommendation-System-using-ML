# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Description
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that suggests the most suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed crop selection decisions, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

The system analyzes factors such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the best crops for a given location. It leverages historical data and predictive modeling to generate tailored recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Input Data Collection**: Accepts user inputs like soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical variables where needed.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting for predictions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained on historical datasets and validated for performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Suggests the most suitable crops based on real-time user inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** â€” A programming language for model development and backend scripting.
- **Scikit-learn** â€” Machine learning library for training and evaluating models.
- **Pandas** â€” Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy** â€” Numerical computations and data handling.
- **Flask** â€” Web framework for developing the server-side application.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** â€” Frontend development for the user interface.
